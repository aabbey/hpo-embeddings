# I. Skeletal Phenotype

- Tall and slender build
- Long limbs and digits
  - This includes long arms, legs, fingers, and toes.
- Spinal abnormalities
  - Curvature of the spine ([scoliosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis))
- Chest deformities
  - The chest either sinks in ([pectus excavatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum)) or sticks out ([pectus carinatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_carinatum)).
- Oral and dental anomalies
  - High, arched palate and crowded teeth.
- Flat feet
- Hypermobile joints
  - Joints are more flexible than normal.

# II. Ocular Phenotype

- Lens dislocation
  - The lens of the eye is dislocated ([ectopia lentis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopia_lentis)).
- Myopia
  - Near-sightedness is common in Marfan Syndrome.
- Early-onset eye conditions
  - [Glaucoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma) and [cataracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract) can occur earlier than usual.
  - There's an increased risk for [detached retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment).

# III. Cardiovascular Phenotype

- Aortic dilation
  - The aorta may be enlarged or dilated ([aortic aneurysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm)), which can lead to [aortic dissection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection).
- Mitral valve abnormalities
  - [Mitral valve prolapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse) is common, leading to mitral valve regurgitation.
- Heart murmurs
- Arrhythmias
  - Irregular heart rhythms, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

# IV. Pulmonary Phenotype

- Spontaneous pneumothorax
  - Air or gas collects in the chest or pleural space, causing part or all of a lung to collapse ([pneumothorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax)).
- Sleep apnea
- [Emphysema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema)
  - This can occur even without a history of smoking.

# V. Skin and Tissue Phenotype

- Stretch marks
  - These often occur without associated weight gain or loss.
- Skin characteristics
  - Skin may be thin and translucent, especially on the chest and abdomen.
- [Hernia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia)
  - Particularly common in the groin area.

# VI. Neurological Phenotype

  - The dural sac surrounding the spinal cord may widen or balloon, causing various symptoms.
    - Symptoms can include lower back pain, abdominal pain, headaches, or numbness and tingling in the legs.
