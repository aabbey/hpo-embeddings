Physician: Thank you, Sarah. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like Lily has a rare genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome. This disorder affects the nervous system and causes developmental delays, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, and seizures. We'll need to run some tests to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.
