Dr. Miller: Good morning, I'm Dr. Miller. I understand this is a difficult time for you, and I appreciate your patience as we work to understand your child's condition better. Could you remind me of your name, and your child's name?

Parent: Yeah, I'm Karen. My son is Jack.

Dr. Miller: Nice to meet you, Karen, and it's a pleasure to be helping Jack. Now, let's start with some general questions. How has Jack been doing overall?

Parent: Overall? Well, he's not like other kids his age. He's got problems, doctor. He's always been weak, a bit floppy even. And he drools a lot, more than normal. He's also super clumsy, can't walk straight at all, keeps tripping over himself.

Dr. Miller: I see, Karen, thank you for sharing that. When you say he's weak and floppy, do you mean he has difficulty with things like holding his head up, or grabbing things?

Parent: Yeah, exactly. His body is like a noodle, can't seem to hold himself up properly. And his grip, it's weak.

Dr. Miller: That's helpful to know, Karen. You also mentioned he drools a lot and he's quite clumsy. Has he always been this way or did these traits develop over time?

Parent: I started noticing it more and more as he got older. Especially the clumsiness, he's getting worse. He used to just stumble a bit, but now he can hardly walk without help.

Dr. Miller: Noted. Now, about his facial features, are there any distinct traits that you've noticed?

Parent: His face? Yeah, his eyes are really deep-set, and his mouth is wide. And he's got a bit of an underbite, his lower jaw sticks out more than it should. And his eyes, they're blue, a deep, beautiful blue.

Dr. Miller: Thank you for describing that, Karen. Let's talk about his behavior and habits. Can you tell me about his sleep patterns?

Parent: His sleep is all over the place. He's up at odd hours and can't seem to stick to a normal sleep routine. And he's hyperactive, always on the go when he's awake.

Dr. Miller: That must be challenging for you both. Have you noticed anything unusual about Jack's mental development or intellectual abilities?

Parent: You mean, is he slow? Yeah, he is. He's not picking up things like other kids his age. And I hate to say it, but it seems like he's getting worse, not better.

Dr. Miller: I understand your concern, Karen. This is all very valuable information. Lastly, has anyone else in your family had similar symptoms, or is this the first time you're seeing these traits in your family?

Parent: No, nobody else in the family has anything like this. Just my poor Jack. It's all just him.

Dr. Miller: Thank you for sharing, Karen. I know this is hard. I appreciate your patience and openness. It will help us to better understand and address Jack's condition.
