Physician: I see. Does he have any other delays or difficulties?

Parent: Yes, he also has speech delay and cognitive impairment. He has trouble feeding and has seizures sometimes.

Physician: I'm sorry to hear that. Does he have any hearing or vision problems?

Parent: Yes, he has hearing loss and vision impairment. He also has some physical abnormalities.

Physician: Thank you for telling me all of this. Has he been diagnosed with any conditions or syndromes?

Parent: Yes, he has been diagnosed with hypotonia and heart defects. He's also hyperactive and impulsive.

Physician: I understand. Has he had any genetic testing or imaging done?

Parent: Yes, he has had genetic testing and an MRI done, but we haven't gotten the results yet.

Physician: I see. It sounds like James has a complex medical history. Is there anything else you can tell me about him?

Parent: No, I think that covers everything. We've been through a lot with him already and we just want to figure out how to help him.
