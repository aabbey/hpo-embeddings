    "transcript": "Physician: Hello, I'm Dr. Anderson. I believe you're Mr. Jones, correct? And this must be little Timmy.\n\nParent: Yes, that's correct. Timmy's been having a rough go of it lately.\n\nPhysician: I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Jones. I assure you, we're here to help. Let's begin by discussing Timmy's overall health. How has he been doing recently?\n\nParent: He's been really tired, doc, always lethargic. Seems to have no energy, and it scares me.\n\nPhysician: I see, so lethargy is an issue. Does Timmy have trouble sleeping?\n\nParent: No, not really. He sleeps fine, even too much if you ask me. Sometimes he stops breathing in his sleep, scares the life out of me.\n\nPhysician: That's certainly concerning. Sounds like apnea. Has Timmy ever had seizures?\n\nParent: Yeah, doc. He gets these horrible seizures. They're not just in one side of his body, they're everywhere. And sometimes it's just like a shock going through his body.\n\nPhysician: Sounds like Bilateral tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. How frequently do they occur?\n\nParent: Too often, doc. And every time, he gets all weak in his limbs afterward.\n\nPhysician: That indeed correlates with seizure activity. How about his vision and hearing? Have you noticed any changes there?\n\nParent: He doesn't respond to sounds as much as he used to. He doesn't follow objects with his eyes either. It's like he can't see them, or maybe he just doesn't understand.\n\nPhysician: It might be a sign of sensorineural hearing impairment and nonprogressive visual loss. Tell me, has Timmy had any infections recently?\n\nParent: More than I can count, doc. He's constantly getting sick, especially with colds and flus.\n\nPhysician: Recurrent infections may point to an abnormality in the immune system. Has Timmy had any rashes or skin issues?\n\nParent: Yeah, he gets this red, itchy rash. Sometimes it looks like eczema.\n\nPhysician: That could be eczematoid dermatitis. Considering Timmy's symptoms, it sounds like he has issues with his nervous system, given the seizures, muscle weakness, and potential myelopathy. Have you noticed anything else unusual, like his urine having a strange smell or him having trouble with learning or understanding?\n\nParent: Well, now that you mention it, his diapers do smell a bit odd. And he isn't hitting the milestones that my other kids did at his age. I don't expect him to be a genius, but he seems slower to pick things up.\n\nPhysician: This could indicate organic aciduria and some degree of intellectual disability. Let's plan for some further tests to confirm. It's important to note, Mr. Jones, that Timmy's condition is complex, but we're dedicated to helping him.",
