    "transcript": "Physician: Good afternoon, I'm Dr. Smith. What's your child's name?\n\nParent: Hi, I'm Sarah, and my child's name is Lily.\n\nPhysician: Nice to meet you, Sarah. How old is Lily?\n\nParent: She's 2 years old.\n\nPhysician: Can you tell me a little about Lily's health history?\n\nParent: Well, she was born premature at 34 weeks and spent some time in the NICU. She's had a lot of health issues since then, and we're really worried about her.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Can you tell me about any physical traits you've noticed in Lily?\n\nParent: Sure. She has fair hair, a wide mouth, and her tongue sticks out a bit. Her eyes also tend to wander a bit. She's also very clumsy and has a broad-based gait.\n\nPhysician: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any tremors or shaking in her limbs?\n\nParent: Yes, she does have some limb tremors. It's really noticeable when she's trying to pick something up.\n\nPhysician: And how is her speech development coming along?\n\nParent: Lily hasn't spoken any words yet, and we're really worried about that. She also drools a lot and has these bursts of laughter that don't seem to match the situation.\n\nPhysician: I see. Has Lily been experiencing any digestive issues?\n\nParent: Yes, she's been having some trouble with constipation. We've been trying to manage it with diet changes, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.\n\nPhysician: Thank you for letting me know. Has Lily been reaching her developmental milestones on time?\n\nParent: No, she's been experiencing a lot of delays. She's severely intellectually disabled and has global developmental delay.\n\nPhysician: I'm sorry to hear that. Has Lily been experiencing any issues with her vision?\n\nParent: Yes, she has strabismus and exotropia, so her eyes don't always work together. It's been really hard for her to focus on things.\n\nPhysician: Thank you for telling me that. Has Lily been experiencing any other issues that you're aware of?\n\nParent: Yes, she's been struggling with obesity and hypotonia. We're also really worried about her because she has cerebral cortical atrophy.\n\nPhysician: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on what you've shared, I'm going to recommend some additional testing to get a better understanding of what's going on with Lily. We'll work together to come up with a treatment plan that's best for her.",
