Patient Encounter Notes

Patient: Jane Doe
Date: September 16, 2023
Clinician: Dr. Emily Thompson, Genetic Counselor
Location: Genetic Insight Clinic, 123 Health St., Medville

Chief Complaint:
Child with unknown rare condition, presenting with an atypical phenotype.

History of Present Illness:

Jane Doe, a 7-year-old female, presents with a series of clinical manifestations that do not fit any recognized syndromic patterns. The primary manifestations include craniofacial dysmorphia, limb anomalies, and unexplained growth delays. The onset of symptoms was noted at age 2, with progressive exacerbation of the limb anomalies.

Medical History:

Hospitalizations: Hospitalized at age 2 for pneumonia.
Surgeries: None.
Medications: Vitamin D supplements.
Family History:

Mother: Healthy, no known genetic conditions.
Father: Healthy, no known genetic conditions.
Siblings: One younger brother, age 3, with no similar symptoms.
Extended family: No reports of similar phenotypic presentations or known genetic conditions.
Previous Genetic Testing:

Whole Exome Sequencing: Conducted on June 5, 2021, at GenTech Labs. Result: No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified.
Chromosomal Microarray Analysis: Conducted on October 10, 2021, at GenTech Labs. Result: Normal karyotype; no copy number variations detected.
Additional Notes: All identified variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have been reviewed, with none currently deemed likely to be responsible for the observed phenotype.
Physical Examination:

Craniofacial examination revealed epicanthic folds, a broad nasal bridge, and a prominent forehead. Limbs showed brachydactyly with mild syndactyly of the 2nd and 3rd fingers bilaterally. Growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference) are below the 5th percentile for age.

Discussion and Plan:

Phenotype Review: Detailed assessment and documentation of the phenotype were carried out, emphasizing any evolving or newly observed features.
Genetic Testing Review: Previous test results were analyzed for potential oversight or updates in variant interpretations.
Next Steps in Testing: Recommended:
Consideration for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to identify any deep intronic mutations or other structural variations not detectable by previous tests.
Potential targeted testing based on evolving phenotype or emerging research on rare conditions.
Research & Collaboration: Suggestion to enroll in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) for deeper insight.
Multidisciplinary Collaboration: Coordinate with a multi-specialist team for comprehensive care and monitoring. Consider involving a neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, and pediatric endocrinologist for focused assessments.
Family Support & Resources: Emphasized the importance of family support groups and connected the family with local and online resources tailored for families of children with undiagnosed conditions.
Follow-Up: Scheduled for 6 months or sooner if any significant changes in phenotype or health occur.
Patient and Family Feedback:

Mrs. Doe expressed gratitude for the continued search for a diagnosis. She acknowledged the challenges in identifying rare and potentially novel conditions but expressed hope for the future with emerging research.

Conclusion:

Continued monitoring and proactive search for a diagnosis are crucial. Support for Jane and the Doe family remains a top priority, coupled with regular reviews of any new genetic research or findings that may shed light on Jane's condition.
