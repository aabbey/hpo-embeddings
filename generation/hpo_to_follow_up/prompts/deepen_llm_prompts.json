The following terms are child terms of '{term}', with definitions included: \n\n '''\n{term_list}\n''' \n\nWhat are some ideas for follow up questions that I can ask the patient that will help me determine a more specific HPO term for the patient, without conducting any new tests? Please reply briefly, without extra filler."
